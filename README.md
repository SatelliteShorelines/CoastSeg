# What is CoastSeg?
CoastSeg is an interactive browser-based program that aims to broaden the adoption of satellite-derived shoreline (SDS) detection and coastal landcover mapping workflows among coastal scientists and coastal resource management practitioners. SDS is a sub-field of coastal sciences that aims to detect and post-process a time-series of shoreline locations from publicly available satellite imagery.

CoastSeg is a Python package installed via pip into a conda environment that serves as an toolkit for building custom SDS workflows. CoastSeg also provides full SDS workflow implementations via Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that call functions and classes in the core CoastSeg toolkit for specific workflows. CoastSeg provides two fully functioning SDS workflows and its design allows for collaborators in the SDS software community to contribute additional workflows. All the codes, notebooks, scripts, and documentation are hosted on the [CoastSeg GitHub repository](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg).

So-called `instantaneous' SDS workflows, such as the implementation of [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat), where shorelines are extracted from each individual satellite image rather than temporal composites, follow a basic recipe, namely:

1) waterline estimation, where the 2D (x,y) location of the land-sea interface is determined
and 
2) water-level correction, where the waterline location is mapped onto a shore-perpendicular transect, converted to a linear distance along that transect, then corrected for water level, and referenced to a particular elevation contour on the beach. 

# Project Aims
CoastSeg has three broad aims. The first aim is to be a toolkit consisting functions that operate the core SDS workflow functionalities. This includes file input/output, image downloading, geospatial conversion, tidal model API handling, mapping 2D shorelines to 1D transect-based measurements, and numerous other functions common to a basic SDS workflow, regardless of a particular waterline estimation methodology. This waterline detection algorithm will be crucial to the success of any SDS workflow because it is the step that identifies the the boundary between sea and land which serves as the basis for shoreline mapping. The idea behind the design of CoastSeg is that users could extend or customize functionality using scripts and notebooks.

The second aim of CoastSeg is therefore to provide fully functioning SDS implementations in an accessible browser notebook format. Our principal objective to date has been to re-implement and improve upon a popular existing toolbox, [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat), allowing the user to carry out the well-established CoastSat SDS workflow, but in a more accessible and convenient way within the CoastSeg platform. In order to achieve this, we developed [CoastSat-package](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/coastsat_package), a Python package that is installed into the CoastSeg conda environment. CoastSat-package contains re-implemented versions of the original CoastSat codes, addresses the lack of pip or conda installability of CoastSat, and isolates the CoastSeg-specific enhancements from the original CoastSat code. 

The third and final aim of CoastSeg is to implement a method to carry out SDS workflows in experimental and collaborative contexts, which aids both oversight and reproducibility as well as practical needs based on division of labor. We do this using sessions, a mechanism for saving the current state of the application into a session's folder. This folder contains all necessary inputs, outputs, and references to downloaded data used to generate the results. Sessions allow users to iteratively experiment with different combinations of settings and makes CoastSeg fully reproducible because everything needed to reproduce the session is saved to the folder. Users can share their sessions with others, enabling peers to replicate experiments, build upon previous work, or access data downloaded by someone else. This simplifies handovers to new users from existing users, simplifies teaching of the program, and encourages collective experimentation which may result in better shoreline data.

CoastSeg is also designed to be extendable, serving as a hub that hosts alternative SDS workflows and similar workflows that can be encoded in a Jupyter notebook built upon the CoastSeg and CoastSat-package core functionalities. Additional notebooks can be designed to carry out shoreline extraction and coastal landcover mapping using alternative methods. We provide an example of an alternative SDS workflow based on a deep-learning based semantic segmentation model that is briefly summarized at the end of this paper. To implement a custom waterline detection workflow the originator of that workflow would contribute new Jupyter notebook, and add their specific waterline detection algorithm to the CoastSeg source code, so it could be used in their notebook's implementation.

# Installation Instructions

CoastSeg is a Jupyter and Python  based program that runs in a conda environment. Please see [the installation guide on the CoastSeg website](https://satelliteshorelines.github.io/CoastSeg/basic-install-guide/)

# Getting Started

Please see [the guide on the CoastSeg website](https://satelliteshorelines.github.io/CoastSeg/getting-started/), which includes instructions for

* Pre-requisites (accounts, data access)
* Installation and setup
* Extracting shorelines
* Applying tidal corrections to extracted shorelines

# CoastSat Re-implementation

The CoastSeg re-implementation of the  [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) workflow is end-to-end within a single notebook. That notebook allows the user to, among other tasks: 

a) define a Region of Interest (ROI) on a webmap and upload geospatial vector format files; 
b) define, download and post-process satellite imagery; 
c) identify waterlines in that imagery using the CoastSat method; 
d) correct those waterlines to elevation-based shorelines using tidal elevation-datum corrections provided through interaction with the [pyTMD](https://github.com/tsutterley/pyTMD) API; and 
e) save output files in a variety of modern geospatial and other formats for subsequent analysis. 

Additionally, CoastSeg's toolkit-based design enables it to run as non-interactive scripts, catering to larger scale shoreline analysis projects. This flexibility ensures that CoastSeg can accommodate a wide range of research needs, from detailed, interactive exploration to extensive, automated analyses.
