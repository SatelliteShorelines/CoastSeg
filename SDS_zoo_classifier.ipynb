    "## How to Run Image Segmentation Models on the Downloaded Imagery\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. Select whether your imagery is type **RGB**,**NDWI**,**MNDWI** or **RGB+MNDWI+NDWI**(which is 5 band imagery).\n",
    " - If you choose a **NDWI**, **MNDWI** or **RGB+MNDWI+NDWI** the **RGB** will automatically be converted to these the selected type.\n",
    "2. Select the model you want to use.\n",
    "3. Select **Ensemble** or **Best** (Ensemble is recommended because it uses multiple models to create more accurate predictions).\n",
    "- **Best:** Uses only the best model available on the images.\n",
    " </br> - Using only the best model typically means each prediction takes less time because only a single model is used to make the prediction. However the resulting segmentation may not be as accurate as with the ensemble model.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "- **Ensemble:** Uses all the models available on the images.\n",
    " </br> - Ensemble modeling uses multiple models to create more accurate predictions, this means it takes longer to make a single predicition but the resulting segmentation will generally be more accurate.\n",
    "4. Select a directory of imagery to run the model.\n",
    "  - Select an ROI directory under the `data` directory\n",
    "  - Always select a directory with 'RGB' as the name.\n",
