# Part 2: Download and Clip the Tide Model

You have two options to download and clip the tide model: use the Jupyter Notebook (Recommended) or using a Script (Alternative). 

### Space and Time Requirements

- **Storage Space:** Ensure you have at least 14GB of free space available.
- **Time Commitment:** The download and setup process for the fes2014 model takes approximately 1-2 hours. This is a one-time requirement.

## Option 1: Using the Download_tide_model.ipynb Notebook (Recommended)

The easiest way to download and clip the tide model is to use this notebook. Run all the code in the notebook and you're done!

1. **Prepare:** Ensure you have you are in an activated coastseg environment and know your AVISO email and password.
2. **Open Notebook:** Launch `Download_tide_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

```
cd CoastSeg
jupyter lab Download_tide_model.ipynb
```

3.**Run Code:** Execute all cells in the notebook. The code will guide you through the download and clipping process automatically.

4.**Check Results:** Confirm that the model files are correctly downloaded and clipped in the specified directory.

# Option 2: Using the Script (Alternative)

## Setup

1. Create Directory: Navigate to your CoastSeg installation directory and create a new folder named tide_model.
2. Script Location: Change directory to the scripts folder within CoastSeg.

```
cd <location of your coastseg directory>
mkdir tide_model
cd scripts
```

![activate_coastseg_tide-Model_download](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg/assets/61564689/9706d481-5538-456d-8c79-b80d0c27b055)

## Download & Clip

1.**Run Download Script:** Execute the `aviso_fes_tides.py` script with the necessary parameters, including your AVISO credentials and target directory for the tide model.

- ⚠️ Enter your AVISO password when prompted. Note that the password won't display as you type. After you have finished typing, press Enter to proceed.
- Replace `C:\Users\Sample\coastseg` with the actual location of your CoastSeg directory.
- ![AVISO Password Prompt](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg/assets/61564689/4e858552-6869-4511-8a87-5caa0f12dd38)

  Example command:

```
 python aviso_fes_tides.py --user your_email@example.com -D C:\Users\Sample\coastseg\tide_model --load --log --tide FES2014 -G
```

2.**Clip Model to Regions:** After downloading, run the `clip_and_write_new_nc_files_cmd_line.py` script with the paths to your tide model directory and the regions geojson file.

To make the tide predictions compute faster we will clip the model it to various regions across the planet. After we've clipped the model to each region, when we want to predict the tide at a particular latitude and longitude we first figure out which region the point lies within, then we load the tide model we clipped to that region.

- `-R or --regions_file` the full path to the regions geojson file. You should find this file `tide_regions_map.geojson` in the `scripts`
- `-T or --tide_model` the full path to the directory containing the tide model downloaded
- Replace `C:\Users\Sample\coastseg` with the actual location of your CoastSeg directory.

```
python clip_and_write_new_nc_files_cmd_line.py -T C:\Users\Sample\coastseg\tide_model -R C:\Users\Sample\coastseg\scripts\tide_regions_map.geojson
```

3.**Validate:** Ensure each region directory under tide_model contains clipped tide model files.

- Each region will have the same format as region0 the full list of files is omitted for brevity.

## Running into Problems?

---

1. Your account may not be verified yet, which means you can't download the model
2. Occasionally the AVISO server goes down. Wait a few hours and try again and see if its working.

### Troubleshooting

If you are running coastseg on a secure network you may need to make the following modifications to your `.condarc` file.

1. If you get an error message similar to `CondaValueError: You have chosen a non-default solver backend(libmamba) but it was not recongized`
   - Solution: comment out the line in the .condarc file `solve:libmamba`
2. You may also need to modify the `ssl_verify` to either True or False depending on your network security.
   - Always switch `ssl_verify` to True if you ever set it it to False for debugging purposes.

# How to Perform Tide Correction

⚠️ You must have run the script to download the FES2014 tide model before attempting to correct tides
This script provides utilities for modeling tides and correcting time series data based on tide predictions.

## ⚠️ Important: Read Before Using Tide Correction Button

If the tide model was NOT downloaded to `CoastSeg/tide_model` then the tide correction button will NOT work. The tide correction button will try to load the tide model from `<CoastSeg location>/tide_model` and an error will occur. Instead follow the instructions in at [Option 2: Tide Correction Script](#option-2-tide-correction-script)

If you downloaded the tide model to a different location follow the instructions at [Option 2: Tide Correction Script](#option-2-tide-correction-script)
to use the script `apply_tidal_correction.py`

## Option 1: Tide Correction Button Method

Ever since coastseg 1.1.0 released you can now use the `correct tides` button in coastseg to automatically correct the timeseries. This button will automatically find which files need to be tidally corrected and apply the tidal correction for you.

## ⚠️ Important

If the tide model was NOT downloaded to `CoastSeg/tide_model` then the tide correction button will NOT work. The tide correction button will try to load the tide model from `<CoastSeg location>/tide_model` and an error will occur. Instead follow the instructions in at [Option 2: Tide Correction Script](#option-2-tide-correction-script)

### Steps

**WARNING**
You must have downloaded the tide model to the `tide_model` folder within coastseg for this button to work correctly.

1.**Enter the beach slope**

- This is the beach slope in meters for the ROI you have selected.

  2.**Enter the beach elevation**

- This is the beach elevation in meters for the ROI you have selected.

  3.**Select the ROIs' ids to tidally correct**

  4.**Click compute tides and wait a few minutes.**

If you encounter any issues or have any questions please submit an issue at [CoastSeg Issues](https://github.com/Doodleverse/CoastSeg/issues/new/choose)

![predict-tide_script](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg/assets/61564689/4ce506c2-403e-44e7-9ecd-6a4a4898b870)

## Option 2: Tide Correction Script

⚠️ If the tide model was NOT downloaded to `CoastSeg/tide_model`, then you must use the tide correction script.

### Example 1: Apply Tide Correction to a session and provide tide model location

1. **Choose a session**
   - In this example I will be using session `dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr` and using ROI `ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44`
   - Example: `C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\sessions\dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr\ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44`
2. **Get the location of the config_gdf.geojson file**
   - This parameter is used after the `-C `
   - Example: `-C "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\sessions\dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr\ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44\config_gdf.geojson"`
3. **Get the location of the transect_time_series.csv file**
   - This parameter is used after the `-T `
   - Example: `-T "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\sessions\dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr\ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44\transect_time_series.csv"`
4. **Get the location of the tide_model**
   - This parameter is used after the `-M`
   - Example: `-M "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\tide_model"`
5. Select a Beach Elevation
   - This is the elevation of the beach in meters for the ROI you have selected
   - Example: `-E 3.2`
6. Select a Beach Slope
   - This is the slope of the beach in meters for the ROI you have selected
   - Example: `-S 2.1`
7. **Assemble the command**
   - Assemble all commands into a single line. I recommended using notepad to combine all the commands into a single line
   ```
   python apply_tidal_correction.py -E 3.2 -S 2.1 -C
   "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\sessions\dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr\ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44\config_gdf.geojson" -T
   "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\sessions\dnz3_extract_shorelines_10_yr\ID_dnz3_datetime12-22-23__09_10_44\transect_time_series.csv"
   -M "C:\development\doodleverse\coastseg\CoastSeg\tide_model"
   ```
8. **Run the command**
   - It takes a few minutes to predict the tides
