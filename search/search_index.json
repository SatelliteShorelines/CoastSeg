SDS is a sub-field of coastal sciences that aims to detect and post-process a time-series of shoreline locations from publicly available satellite imagery.</p> <p>CoastSeg is a Python package installed via pip into a conda environment that serves as an toolkit for building custom SDS workflows. CoastSeg also provides full SDS workflow implementations via Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that call functions and classes in the core CoastSeg toolkit for specific workflows. CoastSeg provides two fully functioning SDS workflows and its design allows for collaborators in the SDS software community to contribute additional workflows. All the codes, notebooks, scripts, and documentation are hosted on the CoastSeg GitHub repository.</p> <p></p> <p>So-called `instantaneous' SDS workflows, such as the implementation of CoastSat, where shorelines are extracted from each individual satellite image rather than temporal composites, follow a basic recipe, namely:</p> <ol> <li>waterline estimation, where the 2D (x,y) location of the land-sea interface is determined    and</li> <li>water-level correction, where the waterline location is mapped onto a shore-perpendicular transect, converted to a linear distance along that transect, then corrected for water level, and referenced to a particular elevation contour on the beach.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#project-aims","title":"Project Aims","text":"<p>CoastSeg has three broad aims. The first aim is to be a toolkit consisting functions that operate the core SDS workflow functionalities. This includes file input/output, image downloading, geospatial conversion, tidal model API handling, mapping 2D shorelines to 1D transect-based measurements, and numerous other functions common to a basic SDS workflow, regardless of a particular waterline estimation methodology. This waterline detection algorithm will be crucial to the success of any SDS workflow because it is the step that identifies the the boundary between sea and land which serves as the basis for shoreline mapping. The idea behind the design of CoastSeg is that users could extend or customize functionality using scripts and notebooks.</p> <p>The second aim of CoastSeg is therefore to provide fully functioning SDS implementations in an accessible browser notebook format. Our principal objective to date has been to re-implement and improve upon a popular existing toolbox, CoastSat, allowing the user to carry out the well-established CoastSat SDS workflow, but in a more accessible and convenient way within the CoastSeg platform. In order to achieve this, we developed CoastSat-package, a Python package that is installed into the CoastSeg conda environment. CoastSat-package contains re-implemented versions of the original CoastSat codes, addresses the lack of pip or conda installability of CoastSat, and isolates the CoastSeg-specific enhancements from the original CoastSat code.</p> <p>The third and final aim of CoastSeg is to implement a method to carry out SDS workflows in experimental and collaborative contexts, which aids both oversight and reproducibility as well as practical needs based on division of labor. We do this using sessions, a mechanism for saving the current state of the application into a session's folder. This folder contains all necessary inputs, outputs, and references to downloaded data used to generate the results. Sessions allow users to iteratively experiment with different combinations of settings and makes CoastSeg fully reproducible because everything needed to reproduce the session is saved to the folder. Users can share their sessions with others, enabling peers to replicate experiments, build upon previous work, or access data downloaded by someone else. This simplifies handovers to new users from existing users, simplifies teaching of the program, and encourages collective experimentation which may result in better shoreline data.</p> <p>CoastSeg is also designed to be extendable, serving as a hub that hosts alternative SDS workflows and similar workflows that can be encoded in a Jupyter notebook built upon the CoastSeg and CoastSat-package core functionalities. Additional notebooks can be designed to carry out shoreline extraction and coastal landcover mapping using alternative methods. We provide an example of an alternative SDS workflow based on a deep-learning based semantic segmentation model that is briefly summarized at the end of this paper. To implement a custom waterline detection workflow the originator of that workflow would contribute new Jupyter notebook, and add their specific waterline detection algorithm to the CoastSeg source code, so it could be used in their notebook's implementation.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#utility-scripts","title":"Utility Scripts","text":"<p>CoastSeg comes with a collection of pre-processing script utilities for common i/o problems.

This means all the source code for coastseg is located under the <code>src</code>(short for source) directory. Within the <code>src</code> directory is another directory <code>coastseg</code>, which contains the source code for coastseg. The source code is what provides all the functions that coastseg uses in notebooks located within the main <code>CoastSeg</code> directory (aka not within the <code>src/coastseg</code> directory). If you want to make any changes to the functionality of coastseg you will be changing the code within the source directory.</p> <p>The UI used in the two notebooks is stored within <code>map_UI.py</code> and <code>models_UI.py</code>. In these files you will find one class that creates all the buttons, widgets and even a map that coastseg uses. By separating the UI from the source code it makes it easier to make UI changes without having to change the source code.</p> <pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 CoastSeg\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |_ coastseg\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_ __init__.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_bbox.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_roi.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_shoreline.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_transects.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_coastseg_map.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_exception_handler.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_extracted_shoreline.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_common.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_exceptions.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_map_UI.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_models_UI.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_zoo_model.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |_coastseg_logs.py\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |bounding_boxes # contains geojson files for the bounding boxes for the shorelines coastseg automatically loads on the map\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |downloaded_models # directory created by coastseg after a model is downloaded\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |shorelines # contains geojson files the shorelines coastseg automatically loads on the map\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 |  |  |transects # contains geojson files the transects coastseg automatically loads on the map\n|\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   |_config.md\n|   |_install.md # not showing them all here\n|\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests # this directory contains automated tests and test data used to run tests\n|   |_ test_data # this directory contains data used by the automated tests\n|   | |_&lt;data used to test coastseg&gt;\n|   |_ __init__.py\n|   |   |_ conftest.py # creates objects and variables used by the rest of the tests\n|   |   |_ test_roi.py # this test file tests roi.py\n|\n|___data\n|    |_ &lt;data downloaded here&gt; # directory automatically created by coastseg when imagery is downloaded\n|\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .github\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Getting-Started_to_contribute/","title":"Getting Started to Contribute","text":""},{"location":"Getting-Started_to_contribute/#getting-started-guide-for-contributors","title":"Getting Started Guide for Contributors","text":"<p>Ready to contribute?

A smaller along_dist value would restrict the intersection calculation to points closer to the transect, reducing potential noise from farther points.</p> </li> </ul> <p>3.Maximum Standard Deviation <code>max_std</code></p> <p>Limits the variability of shoreline points used to compute the median intersection, reducing the influence of outliers.</p> <p><code>max_std</code> is the maximum acceptable standard deviation (in meters) for the shoreline points when calculating the median intersection. If the standard deviation of the points is above this value, the function will return NaN if in 'nan' mode or if in 'max' mode the maximum intersection will be returned.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Increase : A complex shoreline with a lot of variability might necessitate a higher <code>max_std</code> value. However, a larger <code>max_std</code> might also lead to the inclusion of more outliers, so use this parameter carefully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decrease : You might want to decrease this value when the intersections are based on a group of shoreline points that are close to each other in the cross-shore direction, ensuring a more precise median intersection. This could be beneficial when the shoreline data are of high quality with limited cross-shore variability.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4.Maximum Range <code>max_range</code></p> <p>Specifies the maximum range (in meters) allowed for the shoreline points when calculating the median intersection. If the range is larger than this, the function may return NaN or use the maximum intersection, depending on other settings.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Increase: For a complex, irregular shoreline, a larger <code>max_range</code> might be required. However, as with <code>max_std</code>, a larger <code>max_range</code> could also introduce more dispersion in the intersection points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decrease: Similar to 'max_std', you might want to decrease this value to ensure a more precise median intersection when the shoreline data are of high quality with limited cross-shore range. Decreasing 'max_range' will exclude intersections that are based on points with a large range in the cross-shore direction.</p> </li> </ul> <p>5.Minimum Chainage <code>min_chainage</code></p> <p>The furthest landward distance (in meters) from the transect origin that an intersection is accepted. Beyond this point, the function returns NaN for the intersection.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Increase : If your shoreline has a lot of landward variation or recesses, you might need to increase this value. However, this could also increase the risk of including irrelevant points landward of the actual shoreline.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decrease : Decreasing this parameter might be useful when the shoreline does not have significant landward recesses and users want to exclude points that are too far landward of the transect origin. This could help avoid irrelevant points from impacting the intersection calculation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>6.Percentage Multiple <code>prc_multiple</code></p> <p>In 'auto' mode, this setting decides when to switch from NaN (indicating no reliable intersection) to the maximum intersection value based on shoreline data variability.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the percentage of data points where the standard deviation is larger than <code>max_std</code> is above this value, the function will switch to returning the maximum intersection.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your shoreline is complex and you're using the <code>auto</code> mode, you might need to adjust this value based on the specific dispersion characteristics of your data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>7.Multiple Intersections Mode <code>multiple_inter</code></p> <p>Manages scenarios where multiple potential shoreline intersections occur along a single transect.</p> <p>This is quite common, for example when there is a lagoon behind the beach and the transect crosses two water bodies. The function will analyze transect by transect to identify these kinds of cases and depending on the selected mode choose to:</p> <ul> <li>'nan':</li> </ul> <p>-- Always assign a NaN when there are multiple intersections.</p> <ul> <li>'max':</li> </ul> <p>-- Always take the max (intersection the furthest seaward).</p> <ul> <li>'auto':</li> </ul> <p>-- Switch from returning NaN to returning the maximum intersection if a certain percentage of data points have a standard deviation larger than <code>max_std</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your shoreline is complex, which means the intersections have high dispersion (i.e., large standard deviation or range) <code>auto</code> mode should be beneficial as it automatically decides whether to use NaN or the maximum intersection based on the percentage of points exceeding <code>max_std</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If 'auto' is chosen, the <code>prc_multiple</code> parameter will define when to use the max, by default it is set to 0.1, which means that if 10% of the time-series show multiple intersections, then the function thinks there are two water bodies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extract_shorelines/","title":"Extract Shorelines From Downloaded Imagery","text":"<p>Extracted Shorelines are vectors created from satellite imagery to outline coastlines.</p> <p>CoastSeg will generate the following files containing the 2D shorelines extracted from the imagery:</p> <p>1.<code>extracted_shorelines_lines.geojson</code>: this contains the 2D extracted shorelines formatted as lines</p> <p>2.<code>extracted_shorelines_points.geojson</code>: this contains the 2D extracted shorelines formatted as points</p> <p>3.<code>extracted_shorelines_dict.json</code>: this contains all the extracted shorelines stored in a json format containing metadata like the satellite the shoreline was derived from and more.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"extract_shorelines/#why-is-there-not-an-extracted-shoreline-for-my-roi","title":"Why is there not an extracted shoreline for my ROI?","text":"<p>Sometimes shorelines will be not be able to be extracted from any of the imagery downloaded for the ROI on the map due to image quality issues such as excessive cloud cover or too many 'no data'(black) pixels in the downloaded imagery.
